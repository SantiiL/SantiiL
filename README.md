### Hi there! I'm Santiago 👋
**Senior Backend Software Engineer +6 YOE (Java/Python)**

🔭 **Current Status:**
I am currently working on high-scale microservices architectures.
⚠️ **Note on Activity:** Most of my coding activity (40k+ RPM systems) happens on private enterprise repositories (GitLab/Bitbucket) protected by NDAs, so my public GitHub heatmap does not reflect my daily output.

🌱 **Current Focus:**
- AI-assisted Development (Cursor/Copilot)
- Backend Performance Optimization
